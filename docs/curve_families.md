# Curve Families

Qaws supports thirteen curve families. Each is created through a descriptor struct and a `qaws_curve_create_*` function. After creation, all families share the same evaluation, sampling, traversal, and inspection APIs.

---

## Bezier

**Header:** `qaws_bezier.h`

Polynomial curves defined by control points. The curve interpolates the first and last control points and is influenced by the intermediate ones.

- **Degree:** 1 (linear), 2 (quadratic), 3 (cubic), or higher
- **Spans:** 1
- **Continuity:** C0 (single span, no joints)
- **Closed:** no
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**When to use:** Single-segment curves where you need direct control over shape via a control polygon.

```c
qaws_vec2 pts[] = { {0,0}, {0,1}, {1,1}, {1,0} };
qaws_bezier_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .degree = 3,
    .control_points = pts,
    .control_point_count = 4
};
qaws_curve* c = NULL;
qaws_curve_create_bezier(&desc, &c);
```

---

## Hermite

**Header:** `qaws_hermite.h`

Interpolating curves defined by points and tangent vectors at each point. Cubic Hermite is the most common variant.

- **Degree:** 3 (cubic)
- **Spans:** point_count - 1
- **Continuity:** C1 (tangent continuous at joints)
- **Closed:** no
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**When to use:** When you know both positions and tangent directions at each keypoint.

```c
qaws_vec2 points[] = { {0,0}, {1,0} };
qaws_vec2 tangents[] = { {1,1}, {1,-1} };
qaws_hermite_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .degree = 3,
    .points = points,
    .derivatives = tangents,
    .point_count = 2,
    .derivative_count = 2
};
```

---

## Catmull-Rom

**Header:** `qaws_catmull_rom.h`

Cubic interpolating splines that pass through control points. The tangent at each point is derived automatically from neighboring points.

- **Degree:** 3 (cubic)
- **Spans:** control_point_count - 3 (open), or control_point_count (closed)
- **Continuity:** C1
- **Closed:** yes (optional)
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**Parameterization choices:**

| Mode | Description | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `UNIFORM` | Equal parameter spacing | Fast but can produce cusps |
| `CHORDAL` | Spacing proportional to chord length | Avoids cusps, can overshoot |
| `CENTRIPETAL` | Spacing proportional to sqrt(chord length) | Best general-purpose choice |

**When to use:** Automatic smooth interpolation through a set of points, no tangent specification needed.

```c
qaws_vec2 pts[] = { {0,0}, {1,2}, {2,0}, {3,2} };
qaws_catmull_rom_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .control_points = pts,
    .control_point_count = 4,
    .parameterization = QAWS_PARAMETERIZATION_CENTRIPETAL,
    .closed = 0
};
```

Note: For an open Catmull-Rom, the first and last control points are "ghost" points used to define tangents at the second and second-to-last points. The curve interpolates the interior points only.

---

## B-Spline

**Header:** `qaws_bspline.h`

General-purpose piecewise polynomial curves with local control. Moving one control point only affects a limited portion of the curve.

- **Degree:** arbitrary (commonly 3)
- **Spans:** determined by knot vector and degree
- **Continuity:** up to C(degree-1) at internal knots
- **Closed:** yes (optional)
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**Knot vector:** Can be uniform (auto-generated) or custom. A clamped uniform knot vector makes the curve interpolate the first and last control points.

**When to use:** CAD applications, complex multi-segment curves, situations where local control matters.

```c
qaws_vec2 pts[] = { {0,0}, {1,2}, {3,2}, {4,0} };
qaws_bspline_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .degree = 3,
    .control_points = pts,
    .control_point_count = 4,
    .knots = NULL,    // auto-generate clamped uniform
    .knot_count = 0,
    .is_uniform = 1,
    .is_closed = 0
};
```

---

## NURBS

**Header:** `qaws_nurbs.h`

Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines. Extends B-Splines with per-control-point weights, enabling exact representation of circles, ellipses, and conic sections.

- **Degree:** arbitrary (commonly 2 or 3)
- **Spans:** determined by knot vector and degree
- **Continuity:** up to C(degree-1) at internal knots
- **Closed:** yes (optional)
- **Rational:** yes
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**When to use:** Exact circles and conics, CAD interchange, any situation where B-Splines are insufficient.

```c
// Quarter circle
qaws_vec2 pts[] = { {1,0}, {1,1}, {0,1} };
qaws_scalar knots[] = { 0,0,0, 1,1,1 };
qaws_scalar weights[] = { 1, 0.70710678118f, 1 };
qaws_nurbs_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .degree = 2,
    .control_points = pts,
    .control_point_count = 3,
    .knots = knots,
    .knot_count = 6,
    .weights = weights,
    .weight_count = 3,
    .is_closed = 0
};
```

---

## Trajectory

**Header:** `qaws_trajectory.h`

Time-keyed interpolating curves with optional velocity and acceleration constraints. Natural for animation and motion control.

- **Degree:** 3 (cubic)
- **Spans:** key_count - 1
- **Continuity:** C1
- **Closed:** yes (optional)
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**When to use:** Animation keyframes, motion paths with timing, robotic trajectories.

```c
qaws_vec2 positions[] = { {0,0}, {5,3}, {10,0} };
qaws_scalar times[] = { 0.0f, 1.0f, 2.0f };
qaws_trajectory_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .degree = 3,
    .key_positions = positions,
    .key_count = 3,
    .key_times = times,
    .key_time_count = 3,
    .key_velocities = NULL,
    .key_velocity_count = 0,
    .key_accelerations = NULL,
    .key_acceleration_count = 0,
    .closed = 0
};
```

## Yuksel C2 Interpolating Splines

**Header:** `qaws_yuksel.h`

Based on Cem Yuksel's "A Class of C2 Interpolating Splines" (2020). These curves interpolate all control points with C2 continuity, without requiring tangent input.

- **Degree:** 2 (quadratic sub-curves, blended)
- **Spans:** control_point_count - 1 (open), or control_point_count (closed)
- **Continuity:** C2 (achieved through cos^2/sin^2 blending)
- **Closed:** yes (optional)
- **Dimension:** 2D and 3D (Bezier mode); 2D only (Circular/Elliptical/Hybrid)

### Interpolation modes

| Mode | Description | Dimension |
|---|---|---|
| `BEZIER` | Quadratic Bezier sub-curves through point triplets | 2D, 3D |
| `CIRCULAR` | Circular arcs through point triplets | 2D only |
| `ELLIPTICAL` | Elliptical arcs with iterative fitting | 2D only |
| `HYBRID` | Circular when arc angle is small, elliptical otherwise | 2D only |

### How it works

For each control point P[i], a sub-curve is computed from the triplet (P[i-1], P[i], P[i+1]). Adjacent sub-curves are blended using cos^2 and sin^2 weights:

```
P(t) = cos^2(pi*t/2) * subcurve_left(t) + sin^2(pi*t/2) * subcurve_right(t)
```

This blending gives C2 continuity everywhere.

**When to use:** Smooth interpolation with higher continuity than Catmull-Rom, no tangent specification needed.

```c
qaws_vec2 pts[] = { {0,0}, {1,2}, {2,0}, {3,2}, {4,0} };
qaws_yuksel_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .control_points = pts,
    .control_point_count = 5,
    .mode = QAWS_YUKSEL_MODE_BEZIER,
    .closed = 0
};
```

## Rational Bezier

**Header:** `qaws_rational_bezier.h`

Weighted Bezier curves that extend standard Bezier curves with per-control-point weights. Evaluation uses the homogeneous (rational) De Casteljau algorithm, enabling exact representation of conic sections such as circles and ellipses within a single span.

- **Degree:** arbitrary (commonly 2 or 3)
- **Spans:** 1
- **Continuity:** C0 (single span, no joints)
- **Rational:** yes
- **Closed:** no
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**When to use:** Single-segment rational curves, exact conics, or when per-point weighting is needed without the full machinery of NURBS and custom knot vectors.

```c
qaws_vec2 pts[] = { {1,0}, {1,1}, {0,1} };
qaws_scalar weights[] = { 1.0f, 0.70710678118f, 1.0f };
qaws_rational_bezier_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .degree = 2,
    .control_points = pts,
    .control_point_count = 3,
    .weights = weights,
    .weight_count = 3
};
qaws_curve* c = NULL;
qaws_curve_create_rational_bezier(&desc, &c);
```

## Arc

**Header:** `qaws_arc.h`

Circular and elliptical arcs defined by center, radius, and angular range. In 2D, angles are measured counter-clockwise from the +x axis. In 3D, the arc plane is specified with two orthonormal basis vectors (`axis_u`, `axis_v`). Multiple arc segments can be chained in a single descriptor.

- **Degree:** N/A (analytic)
- **Spans:** segment_count
- **Continuity:** C-infinity within each segment
- **Closed:** depends on angle range
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**When to use:** Circular paths, rounded corners, cam profiles, or any geometry that is naturally described by angular sweeps.

```c
qaws_arc_segment seg = {
    .center = {0, 0, 0},
    .radius = 1.0f,
    .angle_start = 0.0f,
    .angle_end = 3.14159265f,   /* half circle */
    .axis_u = {1, 0, 0},       /* 3D only */
    .axis_v = {0, 1, 0}        /* 3D only */
};
qaws_arc_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .segments = &seg,
    .segment_count = 1
};
qaws_curve* c = NULL;
qaws_curve_create_arc(&desc, &c);
```

---

## Polynomial

**Header:** `qaws_polynomial.h`

Explicit polynomial curves in monomial (power) form: `C(t) = c0 + c1*t + c2*t^2 + ... + cn*t^n`. Each coefficient is a 2D or 3D point. Evaluation uses Horner's method for numerical stability. A custom parameter range `[t_min, t_max]` can be specified.

- **Degree:** arbitrary (>= 1)
- **Spans:** 1
- **Continuity:** C-infinity (single polynomial)
- **Closed:** no
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**When to use:** When the curve is already expressed as a polynomial in monomial form, analytical test cases, or integration with systems that output polynomial coefficients.

```c
/* Parabolic arc: C(t) = (0,0) + (1,0)*t + (0,1)*t^2 */
qaws_vec2 coeffs[] = { {0,0}, {1,0}, {0,1} };
qaws_polynomial_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .degree = 2,
    .coefficients = coeffs,
    .coefficient_count = 3,
    .t_min = 0.0f,
    .t_max = 1.0f
};
qaws_curve* c = NULL;
qaws_curve_create_polynomial(&desc, &c);
```

## Clothoid

**Header:** `qaws_clothoid.h`

Euler spirals (Cornu spirals) whose curvature varies linearly with arc length: `kappa(s) = kappa_0 + (kappa_1 - kappa_0) * s / L`. Position is obtained by integrating the Fresnel-like integrals from the origin. 2D only.

- **Degree:** N/A (transcendental)
- **Spans:** 1
- **Continuity:** C-infinity
- **Closed:** no
- **Dimension:** 2D only

**Key parameters:**

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `origin_x`, `origin_y` | Starting point |
| `start_angle` | Initial heading in radians |
| `start_curvature` | Curvature at s = 0 |
| `end_curvature` | Curvature at s = L |
| `length` | Total arc length L (must be > 0) |

**When to use:** Road and railway design, transition curves that smoothly connect straight segments to circular arcs, path planning where curvature continuity is required.

```c
qaws_clothoid_desc desc = {
    .origin_x = 0.0f,
    .origin_y = 0.0f,
    .start_angle = 0.0f,
    .start_curvature = 0.0f,
    .end_curvature = 1.0f,
    .length = 5.0f
};
qaws_curve* c = NULL;
qaws_curve_create_clothoid(&desc, &c);
```

---

## Subdivision

**Header:** `qaws_subdivision.h`

Limit curves produced by iterative subdivision of an initial control polygon. The subdivision scheme determines the continuity and character of the resulting curve. After a configurable number of refinement levels, the subdivided polyline is used as the curve representation.

- **Degree:** depends on scheme (see below)
- **Spans:** determined by refinement
- **Continuity:** depends on scheme
- **Closed:** yes (optional)
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D

**Subdivision schemes:**

| Scheme | Limit Curve | Continuity |
|---|---|---|
| `QAWS_SUBDIVISION_CHAIKIN` | Quadratic B-spline | C1 |
| `QAWS_SUBDIVISION_LANE_RIESENFELD_3` | Cubic B-spline | C2 |
| `QAWS_SUBDIVISION_LANE_RIESENFELD_4` | Quartic B-spline | C3 |

**When to use:** Quick approximation of smooth curves from coarse polygons, artistic tools, situations where a simple "smooth this polyline" operation is needed.

```c
qaws_vec2 pts[] = { {0,0}, {1,2}, {3,1}, {4,3}, {5,0} };
qaws_subdivision_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .scheme = QAWS_SUBDIVISION_CHAIKIN,
    .control_points = pts,
    .control_point_count = 5,
    .closed = 0,
    .refinement_levels = 6
};
qaws_curve* c = NULL;
qaws_curve_create_subdivision(&desc, &c);
```

---

## Composite

**Header:** `qaws_composite.h`

Multi-segment compound curves that chain multiple heterogeneous `qaws_curve` objects end-to-end into a single curve. Each segment occupies one unit in the composite parameter space: segment *i* maps to `[i, i+1]`, giving a total parameter range of `[0, segment_count]`. The composite takes ownership of all segment curve pointers.

- **Degree:** varies per segment
- **Spans:** segment_count
- **Continuity:** depends on how segments meet (user's responsibility)
- **Closed:** depends on segment arrangement
- **Dimension:** 2D, 3D (all segments must share the same dimension)

**When to use:** Combining curves of different types into a single path (e.g., a line followed by an arc followed by a clothoid), tool paths, complex profiles.

```c
/* Assume line_curve and arc_curve are already created */
qaws_curve* segs[] = { line_curve, arc_curve };
qaws_composite_desc desc = {
    .dimension = QAWS_DIMENSION_2D,
    .segments = segs,
    .segment_count = 2
};
qaws_curve* c = NULL;
qaws_curve_create_composite(&desc, &c);
/* line_curve and arc_curve are now owned by c; do not destroy them separately */
```

## Surfaces

Surface types (Bezier patches, B-spline surfaces, NURBS surfaces, swept surfaces, and ruled surfaces) are documented in [Surfaces](surfaces.md).
